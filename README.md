Week 1 - Environmental Monitoring and Pollution Control

This repository contains the Week 1 milestone of the Shell–Edunet–AICTE Internship project.
The focus of this milestone is on data loading, preprocessing, and visualization for air quality monitoring.

Tasks Completed:
Imported an air quality dataset in CSV format.
Performed data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and renaming columns.
Conducted data visualization using:
Histogram to study the distribution of NO2.
Scatter plot to analyze the relationship between CO and Ozone.
Correlation heatmap to identify relationships between multiple pollutants.

Files Included:
Week1.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing dataset preprocessing and visualization.
air_quality_sample.csv: Example dataset (for use with Google Colab upload).
README.md: Project overview and milestone description.

Week 2 - Machine Learning Model Implementation

In Week 2, the focus was on selecting, implementing, and evaluating a machine learning model for air quality prediction.

Tasks Completed:
- Selected Linear Regression as the machine learning model.  
- Trained the model to predict Ozone levels using features such as CO, NO2, PM2.5, PM10, Temperature, and Humidity.  
- Evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² score.  
- Visualized Actual vs Predicted Ozone levels through scatter plots.  

Files:
- `Week2.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing model training, evaluation, and visualization.
